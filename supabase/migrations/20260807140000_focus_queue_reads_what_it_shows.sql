-- [#534] The focus queue reads what it shows, not the whole workspace.
--
-- MEASURED: scripts/ops/query-load.mjs at 50,000 conversations and 200,000
-- messages in one workspace. api_for_you took 257ms and was the last hot query
-- over 200ms after the inbox fix in 9c383266. EXPLAIN of the body with literals
-- put 201ms of it in one place: the base CTE.
--
-- That CTE computes, for EVERY open conversation a person could possibly be
-- shown, whether it is unread — an EXISTS over messages wrapping a correlated
-- read of conversation_reads. It is materialised because four sections read it,
-- so the expensive column is evaluated for all of them before any section
-- applies its own limit of twenty.
--
-- Two facts make that avoidable. Every consumer that FILTERS or SORTS on unread
-- also requires the row to be assigned to this person, which is a small set. The
-- two that need it for anything else only DISPLAY it, on at most twenty rows.
--
-- So the base computes it only for rows assigned to the reader, and the two
-- display sections read it after their limit. 257ms to 78ms, and the base CTE
-- from 201ms to 21ms.
--
-- THE THREE-VALUED-LOGIC TRAP, recorded because it cost a measurement. The first
-- attempt guarded the expensive half with
--   (c.assigned_user_id = p_user_id and exists (...))
-- on the assumption that AND short-circuits. For an UNASSIGNED row that
-- comparison is NULL, not false, and "NULL and x" must still evaluate x to know
-- whether the answer is NULL or false — so the EXISTS ran for exactly the rows it
-- was supposed to skip. Measured saving: none, 257ms to 253ms. CASE is
-- short-circuiting by definition and does what the AND only looked like it did.
--
-- The whole body is restated because a shipped migration is never edited
-- (D7/D14), and the base copied is the latest definition.
